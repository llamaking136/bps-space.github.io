## Software

-   [KiCad] - is a free and open source PCB CAD program that has all the features
    any hobbyist would need plus more
-   [EasyEDA] - is a free, but proprietary, web-based PCB CAD suite that has
    lots of features and integrates well with their creator, [JLCPCB],
    very well.
-   [EAGLE] - a commercial PCB CAD program offered by Autodesk. It is possible
    to get for free as a student or hobbyist, but autodesk makes it hard to find

## PCB Fabricators

-   [JLCPCB] - Extremely cheap prototypes PCBs. Shipping takes longer and costs
    more since it's in China.
-   [OSH Park][osh-park] - High quality PCBs made in the US. Well respected among
    hobbyists and professionals alike.

## Parts Suppliers

-   [DigiKey] - Reputable US based parts supplier. Ships quickly.
-   [Mouser] - About on par with DigiKey. Down to personal preference at that point.
-   [LCSC] - Cheap parts, and integrates well with [JLCPCB] and [EasyEDA]. The part
    stock is comprised of many cheap chinese versions of normal parts. Not recomended
    since shipping costs make up for the cost savings you get.

-   [PEI Genesis][pei-gen] - Has a useful database for finding connectors and compatibility
